    question: "What is fiber optic technology, and how does it work?",
    answer:
      "Fiber optic technology uses thin strands of glass or plastic to transmit data in the form of light pulses. These pulses travel through the fiber cables, reflecting off the walls due to total internal reflection, ensuring minimal signal loss over long distances. This enables faster data transmission and higher bandwidth compared to traditional copper cables",

Optimizando el enrollamiento de fibras a través de una innovadora trayectoria de cable, la instalación de fibras de radio de curvatura bajo (G.657) es más rápida y duradera, lo que permite una activación de servicio inmediata. El BPI incluye áreas de enrollamiento para gestionar fibras conectadas y tubos en espera de manera independiente. Las fibras de 250μm se almacenan en los casetes orientados hacia adelante. El BPI se puede instalar en un conducto técnico o montarse en superficie junto a una canalización. Está diseñado para conexiones de empalme por fusión desde el cable de ascensor hasta los cables de los suscriptores.",

    question: "¿Qué es la tecnología de fibra óptica y cómo funciona?",
    answer:
      "La tecnología de fibra óptica utiliza finas hebras de vidrio o plástico para transmitir datos en forma de pulsos de luz. Estos pulsos viajan a través de los cables de fibra, reflejándose en las paredes debido a la reflexión interna total, lo que garantiza una pérdida mínima de señal en largas distancias. Esto permite una transmisión de datos más rápida y un mayor ancho de banda en comparación con los cables de cobre tradicionales.",
