    question: "What is fiber optic technology, and how does it work?",
    answer:
      "Fiber optic technology uses thin strands of glass or plastic to transmit data in the form of light pulses. These pulses travel through the fiber cables, reflecting off the walls due to total internal reflection, ensuring minimal signal loss over long distances. This enables faster data transmission and higher bandwidth compared to traditional copper cables",

    question: "¿Qué es la tecnología de fibra óptica y cómo funciona?",
    answer:
      "La tecnología de fibra óptica utiliza finas hebras de vidrio o plástico para transmitir datos en forma de pulsos de luz. Estos pulsos viajan a través de los cables de fibra, reflejándose en las paredes debido a la reflexión interna total, lo que garantiza una pérdida mínima de señal en largas distancias. Esto permite una transmisión de datos más rápida y un mayor ancho de banda en comparación con los cables de cobre tradicionales.",
